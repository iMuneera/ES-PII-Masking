# ES-PII Masking



## 🚀 Overview

ES-PII Masking is a project designed to protect sensitive personal information by effectively masking it in data, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations. It follows the **STRIDE framework** to identify and mitigate security threats, leveraging powerful technologies like **SpaCy** and **AES-256** encryption for data security. 

### Key Features:
- **🧠 AI & ML Integrated**: Combines **fine-tuned SpaCy** (for advanced natural language processing) and **machine learning** with regular expressions (regex) to accurately detect and mask Personally Identifiable Information (PII), such as names, phone numbers, and emails.
- **🔒 AES-256 Encryption**: Secures original files through strong encryption to ensure data privacy.
- **💡 Automation**: Automatically deletes encrypted files when the main page is reloaded.
- **🔗 Safety First**: Scans for and flags malicious links to keep your data safe.
- **🛡️ STRIDE Framework**: Identifies and mitigates potential security threats.
